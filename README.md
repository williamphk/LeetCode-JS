# Key Takeaways: 

## 1. Arrays & Hashing

### Two Sum

- Use hash map and a single loop to efficiently solve the problem.

### Contains Duplicate

- Use set to create a collection of unique values.

### Group Anagrams

- Use hash map to sort elements.

### Top K Frequent Element

- Convert a map to array to perform a number of operations like sort, slice and map.

### Product Except Self

- Implement a two-pass algorithm to avoid the division of zero.

### Longest Consecutive Sequence

- Always compare current element to previous element with start at index 1 in array to avoid end-of-array (i.e. undefined) issues.

## 2. Two Pointers

### Valid Palindrome

- Two-pointer technique, check elements in both end of the array.

### Max Area

- A clear condition should be provided in order to adjust the positions of the two pointers.

## 3. Sliding Window

### Max Profit

- A window "slides" forward to explore different buying and selling points.

### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

- A condition should be set to determine when to move the left pointer.

### Minimum Window Substring

- Using a counter to track if the condition is being satistied through the loop.
